      Since 'ls' prints a list of the contents of a directory, using it in an empty folder would have nothing to print and appear to do nothing. In a folder containing files, using it would list the contents of that folder.

      touch

      The primary reason to use the 'git status' command within a repository's folder will print a list of files in the folder containing changes and whether of not they have been staged for commit or not.

# 9 - What does the command 'git add.' do?
      The 'git add.' command stages the files that have changes to be committed.

      git push

 //As a former teacher, I have a tendency to use full sentences and/or essay responses to questions unless the particular question is more of a factual question. Feel free to let me know if you'd like something different. I also noticed questions seemed to be typed in a single line, so I did so for my answers but will also gladly do this differently in the future if you like. I know how frustrating it can be if someone constantly turns in assignments in a different format than expected even if they answered everything correctly.
